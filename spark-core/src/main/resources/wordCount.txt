We are living in an Environment, where multiple Hardware Architectures and Multiple platforms presents. So it is very difficult to write, compile and link the same Application, for each platform and each Architecture separately.

The Java Programming Language solves all the above problems. The Java programming language platform provides a portable, interpreted, high-performance, simple, object-oriented programming language and supporting run-time environment.

Java Design and architecture decisions drew from a variety of languages such as Eiffel, SmallTalk, Objective C, and Cedar/Mesa. Closely observed the problems in the other languages like platform dependent, Pointers complexity, Manual garbage de allocation etc., Java removes the basic problems in other languages.
